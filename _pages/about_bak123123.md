Hello! My name is Kai Feng, my Chinese name is 冯凯. Now I am a PhD student in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Rutgers University. I am currently working with Dr. Vlassis.

My research will focus on Ai4Science. Specifically, my research projects will utilize AI technologies to solve mechanical engineering problems. 

During my spare time, I enjoy hiking and exploring the mountains and natural reserves.
